# Game of Thrones - Firebase
Game of Thrones Filming Location Train Scheduler

"Train is coming!" Hop aboard on the Game of Thrones trains to visit the GoT filming locations. This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data in "real-time". The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. The web application will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.  You can play the role of a train administrator and add/edit/delete train information.  The information will automatically update each minute and is synced across multiple devices and/or browsers.

## App Interface
Instructions:
* Enter new train information and submit to display.
* Click on the update button next to each train to edit the information.
* Click on the remove button next to each train to delete the information
* Make sure you turn up your volume to enjoy the music (for Firefox only).
